Incremental VPC Backup and Restore with associated components viz. Instances(with data) , Associated subnets , Public gateways etc.


Our proposal will facilitate the user to take incremental backup of instances which are created under a VPC and subsequent restore also (either latest or any version which customers want).
    Incremental backup involves storing only the changes made to files or blocks since the last backup (either full or incremental). This reduces storage requirements and speeds 
    up the backup process. A novel mechanism for incremental backup can include the following features:
        - Efficient change detection: Use filesystem snapshots or checksum-based comparisons.
        - Granular tracking: Backups can work at both file and block levels.
        - Metadata-driven backups: Include detailed metadata to support efficient incremental restores.
    Incremental restore involves reconstructing an instance or environment from a base full backup and applying subsequent incremental backups to restore the state to a specific point
      in time. This approach is designed to reduce restore time, ensure accuracy, and minimise resource usage. 
      A novel mechanism for incremental restore introduces :- 
        - Efficient tracking
        - Selective restores
        - Parallelism for enhanced performance.
